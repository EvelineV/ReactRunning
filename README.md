# ReactRunning
A running / pacing calculator made with ReactJS and SASS. To get started, clone the repository, switch to a new virtual environment, and in the terminal, run npm install, and npm install babel-loader babel-core. Then run the project with npm start and check out localhost:8080 in your favourite browser.

This is my practice project for ReactJS. Tutorials used are <a href="http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial-react/setup/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2015/05/15/howto-setup-webpack-on-es6-react-application-with-sass.html">here (Webpack)</a>.
