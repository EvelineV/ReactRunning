# ReactRunning
A running / pacing calculator made with ReactJS and SASS

This is my practice project for ReactJS. Tutorials used are <a href="http://ccoenraets.github.io/es6-tutorial-react/setup/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.jonathan-petitcolas.com/2015/05/15/howto-setup-webpack-on-es6-react-application-with-sass.html">here (Webpack)</a>.

There is still a lot to implement, which will come later. A discussion of running with splits is <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/learn-how-to-run-negative-splits">here</a>.
